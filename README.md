# CSE 60567 - Git Repository for Computer Security Homework Assignments README

I've organized my homework assignments into a Google Colab notebook (Computer_Security_HW2.ipynb) for easy access and readability. Each section of the notebook corresponds to a different topic:

1. **Vigen√®re Cipher Attack**
2. **RSA Algorithm Decryption**
3. **DES Algorithm Decryption**

In each section, you'll find the relevant code along with explanations and comments to help understand the processes involved.

All outputs are printed within the notebook cells for convenient reference. However, in the unlikely event of any issues accessing the Colab notebook, I've also included a .py file that can be executed on a local system.

Please don't hesitate to reach out to me at sshahbaz@nd.edu if you encounter any problems or have any questions. I'll be happy to assist you!
